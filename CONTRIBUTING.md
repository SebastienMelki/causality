## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Go Code

- Follow standard Go conventions and idioms
- Use `gofmt` and `goimports` for formatting
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors explicitly
- Use context for cancellation and timeouts

### Protocol Buffers

- Use clear, descriptive message and field names
- Group related fields together
- Add comments for all services and messages
- Follow [Buf Style Guide](https://docs.buf.build/best-practices/style-guide)
- Version APIs appropriately (v1, v2, etc.)

### Mobile SDK (gomobile)

- Keep platform-specific code minimal
- Use interfaces for platform abstraction
- Handle network failures gracefully
- Implement proper event batching
- Add comprehensive error handling

### WebAssembly

- Minimize binary size
- Use efficient data structures
- Handle browser compatibility issues
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add performance monitoring

### Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions or changes
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks
- `perf:` Performance improvements

Examples:
```
feat: add event collection API to HTTP server
fix: resolve memory leak in analysis engine
docs: update mobile SDK integration guide
test: add unit tests for behavioral pattern matching
perf: optimize event batching for mobile clients
```

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Add integration tests for HTTP API endpoints
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Test mobile SDK on both iOS and Android
- Verify WASM builds in multiple browsers

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/analysis

# Run with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Generate coverage report
make coverage

# Test mobile SDK
make test-mobile

# Test WASM build
make test-wasm
```

### Writing Tests

```go
func TestAnalysisEngine_DetectAnomaly(t *testing.T) {
    // Arrange
    engine := NewAnalysisEngine()
    events := []Event{
        {Type: "login", Timestamp: time.Now()},
        {Type: "suspicious_action", Timestamp: time.Now()},
    }
    
    // Act
    anomaly, err := engine.DetectAnomaly(context.Background(), events)
    
    // Assert
    assert.NoError(t, err)
    assert.NotNil(t, anomaly)
    assert.Equal(t, "suspicious_pattern", anomaly.Type)
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines
